Projects from Scrimba's free courses: [Learn HTML and CSS](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss) and [Learn JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript).

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Find the project in GitHub Issues.
3. Checkout the project branch (e.g., `daily_dribble_newsletter`).
4. Edit files in the project directory (e.g., `projects/daily_dribble_newsletter`) and add images to its `images` subdirectory.
5. Compare the result with the expected design.
6. Create a PR to the matching branch of the upstream repository ([lgmfred/scrimba_challenges](https://github.com/lgmfred/scrimba_challenges)).
7. Once reviewed, merge your project branch into the `main` branch of your fork.
8. Update `index.html` (`projects/index.html`) in `main` to include the newest project solution.
9. Repeat steps 3-8 for each project.
10. Optionally enhance the UI of `index.html`.
11. Set `gh-pages` as GitHub Pages source.
12. View your site at https://USERNAME.github.io/scrimba_challenges/. `USERNAME` is your GitHub username.

Each project has its own directory inside `projects` with HTML, CSS, and image files.
